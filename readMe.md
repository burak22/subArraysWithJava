#What are subarrays?
##A subarray of an N-element array is an array composed from a contiguous block of the original array's elements. 
##For example, if array =  {1,2,3}  then the subarrays are  {1} , {2} , {3} , {1,2} , {2,3} , {1,2,3}
##and something like  {1,3}  would not be a subarray as it's not a contiguous subsection of the original array.
